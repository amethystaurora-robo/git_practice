Following the example in CarExample.java, please use Object Composition to model an Airplane class.
The Airplane class must be composed of at least 4 other classes (as well as any primitive types you'd like).
The Airplane class itself should have a fuel capacity (double) variable, as well as a currentFuelLevel variable.
We'll use these a bit later.


    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Color color = new Color("blue");
         Specs specs = new Specs(true, false, true);
                    Type type = new Type("Boeing", "747");
                    Measurements measurements = new Measurements(300, 400, 400);
                    Airplane myplane = new Airplane(30, 15.3, color, specs, type, measurements);

    }

public class Airplane {
    Color color;
    Specs specs;
    Type type;
    Measurements measurements;


public Airplane(double fuelCapacity, double currentFuelLevel, Color color, Specs specs, Type type, Measurements measurements) {
            this.color = color;
            this.specs = specs;
            this.type = type;
            this.measurements = measurements;
            this.fuelCapacity = fuelCapacity;
            this.currentFuelLevel = currentFuelLevel;

        }
}

public class Color {
    String color;

    public Color (String color) {
        this.color = color;
    }
}

public class Specs {

    boolean isGas;
    boolean isJet;
    boolean requiresCommercialLicense;

    public Specs(boolean isGas, boolean isJet, boolean requiresCommercialLicense) {
        this.isGas = isGas;
        this.isJet = isJet;
        this.requiresCommercialLicense = requiresCommercialLicense;
    }
}

public class Type {

    //instance variables
    String brand;
    String number;

    public Type(String brand, String number) {
        this.brand = brand;
        this.number = number;

    }
}

public class Measurements {

    double wingspan;
    double width;
    double height;

    public Measurements (double wingspan, double width, double height) {
        this.wingspan = wingspan;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;

    }
